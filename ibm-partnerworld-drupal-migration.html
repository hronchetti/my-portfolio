                <p class="project-details__body-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IBM PartnerWorld is sub-section of ibm.com that is tailored to Business Partners. In the past, webpages on PartnerWorld were created and edited manually by development teams; this process was excessive and costly. 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve efficiency, my team was tasked with creating a web-based tool that enabled content marketing employees to produce and edit webpages independently. Our solution saved time and reduced resource dependency by automating webpage design and development. To ensure user satisfaction we tested our product constantly and used the results to make data-driven decisions.

                <h2>Distinctive branding</h2>
                <h3>To help users determine which page elements were the tool and which were the webpage being created I focused on building a visual language that was drastically different to the style guide of IBM. Feedback and user testing suggested that the tools branding was distinctive and easily identifiable against the IBM webpages being produced.</h3>

He is incredibly passionate about his craft, which is showcased through his devotion to ensuring there is a consistent visual design even though were continuously adding patterns - to the extent that he went above and beyond the call of duty in creating and keeping updated a single document detailing the patterns, shared symbols, and examples flows, for the rest of the team to refer to.”</h4>
